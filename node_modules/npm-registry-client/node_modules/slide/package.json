It does almost nothing,\nbut it's super handy.\n\nI use this util in [a real world program](http://npmjs.org/).\n\nYou should use it as an example of how to write your own flow control\nutilities.  You'll never fully appreciate a flow control lib that you\ndidn't write yourself.\n\n## Installation\n\nJust copy the files into your project, and use them that way, or\nyou can do this:\n\n    npm install slide\n\nand then:\n\n    var asyncMap = require(\"slide\").asyncMap\n      , chain = require(\"slide\").chain\n    // use the power!\n\nEnjoy!\n",
